# ETH-AVAX---SmartContract

This Solidity program is a simple "Create a Token" program written in the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to create a contract that stores details about the token, has a mapping of addresses to balances, has a mint function, and has a burn function.

## Description

For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., CreateaToken.sol). Copy and paste the code from the file "Create a Token" in the repository.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile CreateaToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "CreateaToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "CreateaToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the mint function or burn. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function.
