# ETH-AVAX---SmartContract

This Solidity program is a simple "smartContract" program written in the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to create a contract that implements the require(), assert(), and revert() statements. This program has two functions for setting the value to a variable named token. The token variable's numeric value can be updated by calling on these functions. With the three statements, the program confirms that the new value will be greater than zero and distinct from the previous value. 

## Description

For this project, write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., CreateaToken.sol). Copy and paste the code from the file "smartContract.sol" in the repository.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile smartContract.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "smartContract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button. You can now interact with the program.
